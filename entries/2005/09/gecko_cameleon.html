<h3>Gecko, Cameleon and the death of Bugaboo</h3>

<p>So we have an orange Bugaboo Frog stroller. I know, I'm a little embarassed about it, but I still think it's a great product: Bugaboo managed to build a product that is functional, light, beautiful, and appeals both to men and women. It's also expensive, but, judging by how many you see around, it seems like the price was just right. In other words, Bugaboo hit the jackpot with the Frog.</p>

<p>So what did Bugaboo do? They got greedy. The Frog is soon to be retired (no-one sells it any more, at least in San Francisco), and it's being replaced by two models: the Gecko and the Cameleon (see them both at <a href="http://www.bugaboo.com/">bugaboo.com</a>).</p>

<p>In short, the Gecko is like the Frog but a little smaller, a little cheaper (50 bucks, $679 instead of $729), without the (essential!) bar over the seat, and not so good looking (check out the bassinet option, with the metal and straps showing...yuck). If the Frog never existed, I don't think I would have bought this stroller. It's just <i>not quite there...</i>. It seems like Bugaboo really wants you to buy a Cameleon instead.</p>

<p>As for the Cameleon, it's like a Frog, but even bulkier; you can customize its colors, it has an adjustable-height handle bar and shock absorbers with 5 different settings (because I need that...). Oh, and it's something like $150 more than the frog (at $879, that's getting close to $1K!). Again, this seems to miss the target. ONLY movie stars will buy the Cameleon, or you'll be seen as a movie-star wannabe, talk about embarassing...</p>

<p>Sooo...at the risk of alienating all my new daddytypes visitors, I'm going to go ahead and say it: <b>Bugaboo is making a huge mistake with the Gecko and the Cameleon.</b></p>

<p>Thanks to Liz at <a href="http://www.shoplavish.com">Lavish</a> for warning us about the imminent retiring of the Frog, we got ours just in time!</p>
