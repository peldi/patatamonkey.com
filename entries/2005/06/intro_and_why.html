<h3>Intro and what's this about?</h3>

<p>Hello. My name is Peldi and I will be posting to this blog together with my wife Mariah. I have <a href="http://www.peldi.com/blog">another blog</a>, but it's mostly computer programming stuff (really, don't even bother clicking...).</p>

<p>Mariah is a volounteer for the conservation department at the <a href="http://www.asianart.org">Asian Art Museum in San Francisco</a>, and is now 5 months pregnant with our first child (it's a boy!)</p>

<p>Mariah is 31 and I'm about to turn 30. She's an adoptive South Carolinian from Vietnam. I'm Italian and have lived in San Francisco since 2001. We hope to move to Italy some day (maybe in 3 years? or 5? or 10? we'll see...).</p>

<p>We decided to start a parenting blog for a number of reasons: obviously, we wanted some sort of diary of the development of our baby, and have it be easily accessible by our parents and relatives. The most important reason though is that we feel that <b>there's not that much info out there for people like us</b>. Sure, there are tons of pregnancy books and sites, but somehow we haven't found a website of <b>people like us</b>.</p>

<p>I realize that looking for "people like you" is incredibly hard on the Internet, there's <a href="http://www.friendster.com">a whole industry</a> of websites dedicated to the task. Still, it's normal for people not to share too much about their life on the web, you know the Internet is a dark and scary place sometimes...regardless, we decided that if we want to find other expecting couples with similar philosophy on life and tastes, we need to start sharing a bit about ourselves, so that these people can Google us better. ;)</p>

<p>This explains the <b>things we like</b>, <b>parenting things we like</b> and <b>sites like this one</b> sections on the right column of this blog, which we will try to update as we continue blogging.</p>

<p>Once we find people like us, or they find us, we hope that this site will become a good resource for dealing with having a child in this country at this time in history.</p>

<p>Being parents is no joke!<br />
Peldi and Mariah</p>
