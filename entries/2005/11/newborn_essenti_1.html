<h3>Newborn Essential: the Pilates Ball</h3>

<p><img alt="woman1b.jpg" src="../../../imgs/woman1b.jpg" width="198" height="382" /></p>

<p>Ok, forgive the frightening picture, but I thought it was hilarious looking so I had to post it. I can't quite put my finger on what it is, but there's something about the lady and the baby that just makes me shiver. Brrr!</p>

<p>Anyways, we bought a pilates/exercise ball for the last few months of pregnancy, and it was great. Mariah's back hurt so much that she couldn't sit in a single spot for very long (not even in our awesome <a href="../06/la-z-boy_the_ne.html">la-z-boy</a>), and the ball made her sit with her legs spread apart and her spine erect, which somehow was very comfortable. Definitely a well-spent $20, even just for that.</p>

<p>But the power of the ball really comes out with a newborn! The Guids LOVES the ball, and so do my arms. I hold him, sit on it and bounce up and down. It calms him immediately, even the first night home when Mariah's milk hadn't come yet and he was starving.</p>

<p>We now keep it in our bedroom and use it as a last resort: when all else fails, get out of bed and on the ball. It's awesome.</p>

<p>I secretly can't wait until the Guids doesn't need it any longer so that I can bring the ball to my office and make it my secondary chair. Active sitting yo! :)</p>

<p>Just trust me on this one: if you are expecting or have a small baby, get out and get yourself one (a cheap one is fine I think). Don't inflate it the whole way (I think 2/3 is fine), your knees should pretty much be at 90% when you sit on it.</p>

<p>Oh, one thing about the picture: I like the little ring that keeps the ball in place, I gotta admit that the ball by itself might be a bit dangerous (you can fall backwards) - just be careful and you'll be fine, we have the habit of having it touch the bed or a wall before we sit on it.</p>

<p>I think the baby looks pasted into the picture since the lighting on the baby looks different.  Plus, what's going on with the baby's right arm?</p>
