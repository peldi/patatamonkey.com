<h3>Raising a Bilingual Baby - A reading list</h3>

<p>Mariah and I are planning on raising Guido Jack bilingual (English and Italian). My step-brother has raised his three children bilingual, and it's amazing...my little nephew L. would correct my mom's english when he was 3 years old. Love it.</p>

<p>As far as I know, the only rule that my brother and his wife followed was that he would always and only speak italian to the children, while she would always and only speak english with them. When talking to each other, the two parents would speak whatever came first, or a mix of the two, which is what Mariah and I speak pretty much (our mixed language leans more towards english, but italian creeps in more and more, or at least I try...). ;)</p>

<p>Anyways, I want to do some research on raising bilingual babies --- for instance, I heard that they start speaking later than single-language toddlers, but when they do, they're fluent in both languages.</p>

<p>I did a quick Google search and the following look interesting, I'm making a list of links here for me to read later. I'll add comments after I read all this stuff... </p>

<p><a href="http://www.babyworld.co.uk/information/baby/bilingual_babies.asp">Bringing up a Bilingual Baby</a> on babyworld.co.uk - pretty good, got me excited about doing this!<br />
<a href="http://www.bilingualbabies.org">http://www.bilingualbabies.org</a> - don't you love the Internet? Everything you would ever be looking for is already there. Except maybe a Yelp! for pediatricians, but we'll talk about that later...<br />

<p>Since both my wife and I speak English only, we decided to try teaching our kid American Sign Language.  At 9 months we started signing to her, at 12 months The Bean started signing back.  Now at 22 months she uses over 100 signs.  She verbally talks about as much as a normal 22 month old but communicates with her hands extremely well.  The studies on the long term benefits are very recent but so far all the research indicates good things.</p>

<p>We know couples that are raising their children bilingual and doing it way you are: one parent speaks on language and the other parent the other language.  It works for them.<br />
