<h3>Who are you? (The Pressure of Blogging)</h3>

<p>Over the holidays everyone I saw - wether a family member, a friend or even a distant friend of a distant relative - told me that they check patatamonkey.com pretty regularely.</p>

<p>Other friends who just got engaged/married told me that they hope I continue blogging for a while so that when their turn comes to have kids they'll use this site as a resource.</p>

<p>Some other people I don't know have left messages in the comments.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I feel pressured to keep blogging. At the same time, I feel like I have a lot less to blog about. Guido Jack is such a great kid (sleeps, eats, interacts), I rarely have something to vent about. We have settled in our little routine, have stopped buying baby-related equipment (aside from baby books and clothes I guess) and are generally happy just hanging out with each other. Not a whole lot to blog about you see...</p>

<p>Soooooo, my question to you is: who are you, and why do you come to patatamonkey.com? What kind of information are you looking for?</p>

<p>And for other daddy bloggers reading: do you feel my pain? How do you deal?</p>

<p>I agree that its difficult continuing to blog sometimes. I am in a constant state of writers block and I have to dig deep to fill my daily posts. </p>

<p>I too am curious to why exactly people to back to my  blog, is it because of the posts themselves or pics of my son. </p>

<p>You have actually hit on a tangent of a question I have been mulling over for a week or so.  If you will indulge me, I will use your post to throw some ideas against the wall (but I won’t answer the question of who I am, which probably means I am obtuse).</p>

<p>I find it sometimes difficult to post too, especially when nothing is really going on our (my family’s) lives.  Couple the boring life we (ok, I) lead with our perchance for privacy and there are many times I have nothing which I feel like saying to the Internet in general.</p>

<p>The way I (sort of) deal with it is simple:  I don't post to the Internet at large.  Generally, I write posts for two reasons: to make my wife laugh, and to record something for my daughter.  As long as I can accomplish either one of those things, the rest is gravy.</p>

<p>I will admit that I watch my site traffic, and I find my self-esteem slightly influenced by the number of regular visitors I receive (especially as lately I seem to drive visitors away with my posts).  I will also admit that I look at sites like Dadcentric and Dadbloggers, or any site where there are regular commenters and a sense of community, with a small amount of envy.</p>

<p>But, ultimately, I am too reserved and introverted to take a strong part in any online community, so I just I keep my two goals in mind and I keep posting what I want to post.</p>

<p>So why do I read your site (and this goes for you too, Kevin)?  I read your site to see whatever you put on it.  What do I want to see on your site?  Again, whatever you want to put on it.  I don’t think I have ever watched any of your videos (sorry, video bothers me as a medium), but, by god, your Thanksgiving post was funnier than hell, and I loved the picture from the video conference post.  </p>

<p>In general, I read parenting blogs (at last count over 60 in my feed) as a way to see into other peoples lives.  Even blogs like Rebel Dad and Daddy Types, which tend to have clearly stated goals and an amazing ability to focus on them, offer me some insight into who is writing them.  Occasionally, a writer will hit on something I find useful in my own life, but most of the time I am just interested in looking at what someone else has chosen to present to the public.  So I use blogs as a form of people watching, which is great, because I never have to unintentionally catch someone picking their nose.</p>

<p>If people read your blog, you feel pressured to keep blogging. If people don't read your blog, you wonder why bother blogging at all. You can't win. Be happy complete strangers are leaving comments, but take a break when you need to, unless or until we're paying you to put out.</p>

<p>This is what I come to see on your blog:<br />
I just like to see how you guys are doing! :) <br />
Your blog interests me from a perspective of bilingual/international parenting. <br />
I think Guido Jack is darling! <br />
You have your own fresh perspective of parenting and I like your writing style. <br />
You have a cool professional portfolio. <br />
You guys just seem like a cool couple with a nice kid and I like reading about you! <br />
I love your new parent tips and tricks, especially the poster! Genius. I wish we had one when our gal was little.</p>

<p>So there you go. Hope that helps and I'd love to continue reading what you write. Thanks!</p>

<p>I'm a new father of an 8-month-old son.  I didn't blog or read blogs until after he was born.  Since I was busy being a grad student and a new father, and since I don't have many other friends who have had kids, I searched for and found a new community of fathers online who share their own experiences with the world.  After reading along, I decided to start my own blog with my own experiences, but I still look forward to reading through the many parenting blogs I subscribe to (including yours).  I feel that although I don't interact very often, I have gained new knowledge and read about some very interesting people.</p>

<p>Just as every child is different, so is every parent.  It's fun to read about the experiences and the reactions of all different types of fathers as I figure out just what type of father I am.  Thanks for blogging and enriching my knowledge.<br />

<p>I feel your pain.  I've got plenty of things to blog about, but I rarely seem to find the time to blog about it properly.</p>

<p>When I'm jammed up, and pressed for time, I lean on my camera pretty regularly.</p>

<p>Hey There, <br />
Love your blog. Guido Jack is so adorable. I was googling something one day, and patatamonkey came up. Turns out, "The Guids" was born on the same day my daughter was due. (she was eventually born 10 days later). I like to visit patatamonkey from time to time because you always seem to inspire me or give me something cool to think about, so thanks for that!<br />
Best,<br />
Tree<br />

<p>You asked this question months ago, but I only found your site, by an act of God, last night and I am inspired to answer your question: You are posting because you have created a fabulous site better than most of the books out there.  The Girlfriends' Guide to Surviving the First Year being a rare exception. You will turn this into a book and help thousands of people. So keep writing now, when it occurs to you, because you will forget things if you don't.  My son (nickname: Little Cookie) was born in November, so he's just a bit younger than "The Guids". Your site is amazing moral support. MILLE GRAZIE!!!</p>
