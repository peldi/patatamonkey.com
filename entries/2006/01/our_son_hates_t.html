<h3>Our son HATES the bottle: any tips?</h3>

<p>Guido Jack won't take the bottle any more. He's a boob-man 100%. This upsets us a lot. This is NOT what we want.</p>

<p>What's even more upsetting is that he used to take it...ok a little history: at 4 weeks of GJ's life we started trying to give him a bottle, once a day, just so that he would take it. He hated it at first, but after maybe a week of struggling he started eating it (never more than 2 ounces, which would keep him satisfied for an hour or so, but better than nothing, right?). Things were ok for a few weeks (we sort-of got lazy and skipped a few days here and there, but overall we were satisfied). Then, when Guido was 9 weeks old, we went to Italy, and that's where we made the big mistake: the whole time we were there we didn't give him a bottle at all (I think I tried once but there were too many distractions for him). At the same time he made a tremendous developmental jump, starting to smile at people, seeing better and further, we joke that we came back with a different baby than we left with. Well guess what, this new baby won't take the bottle.</p>

<p>He's too old to be fooled that it's really a boob, he knows exactly what it is, he knows that milk comes out of it, and he thinks that it's a torture. The second I put it into his mouth, he starts crying. And gives me this look that says "why are you doing this to me?"</p>

<p>Now, we followed all the advice we read about, namely:<br />
- I give him the bottle, not Mariah<br />
- Mariah is not in the room when I try it<br />
- I wait until he's not overly hungry but hungry enough<br />
- The temperature of the milk is fine (he prefers a little warmer than body temperature)<br />
- We tried EVERY bottle/nipple on the market (settled on Playtex, but now I'm rethinking everything...)<br />
- I wait until he's in a pretty good mood<br />
- Even though before Christmas he would take the bottle while laying down in his bassinette, in the last couple of days I have tried putting him on the boppy and holding him like Mariah does when she feeds him. He seems to want to suck in that position (instead of chewing on the bottle nipple like he does when he's in his bassinette), but the position of the bottle is very awkward, it's just not tilted enough (stupid gravity).</p>

<p>So now we have a 3-months old baby that won't eat the bottle, and we're pissed.</p>

<p>Any advice fellow bloggers?<br />

<p>I would keep trying different bottles. We had a problem with this too and Playtex was the only thing she would even take a little bit. I'm sorry to report that she never would take a bottle for us. And by us I mean anyone in my family that tried (except of course for me, the booby lady!). <br />
She transitioned to a cup very easily though. We started her early, like 8 months old with a sippy cup and she went right for that. Once she hit a year, milk in the cup and never a problem. <br />
I'm sorry we're not much help! Good luck!</p>

<p>I went with the opposite of the advice, at least for transition. I fake nursed. I gave Kira the bottle while holding her against my breast. Sometimes I would start nursing then do the switch. Might be a good way to restart the bottle. FYI, Kira only took the Dr. Browns nipples at first.</p>
