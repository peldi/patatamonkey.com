<h3>Christmas Holidays Videos</h3>

<p>Ciao Italia!</p>

<p>We just got back from Guido's firsts Christmas in Italia, and it was a blast.</p>

<p>I added 103 pictures to the <a href="http://www.guidojack.com/photos/dec-2005/gallery/">December 2005 gallery</a> on guidojack.com, and here are some videos I took while we were there.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p52609142/" target="video">Christmas Eve</a>: hanging out in Uggiate with the family.</li>
<li><a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p80898636/" target="video">Christmas Day</a>: this year we only had a small subset of the family over: 30 people (you think I'm kidding). Here's The Guids on his bis-nonna (great-granma) Enrica.</li>
<li><a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p57596306/" target="video">Sock-Drawer-Crib</a>: sometimes I wonder why we even bought a crib at home. We used sock-drawers padded with a folded-up bath towel wherever we went in Italy and they worked great! Look how happy GJ is in this one.</li>
<li>Views from La Sperduta <a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p82753157/" target="video">one</a>, <a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p10991646/" target="video">two</a> and <a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p44018283/" target="video">three</a>: my dad's new house on the countryside is absolutely stunning. These are the views from it in the winter (imagine what they're like in the other seasons, with the fields full of sunflowers and wheat. I'll take more videos this summer when we go back.</li>
<li><a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p30363583/" target="video">Risotto Contest</a>: the Milan-side of my family takes great pride in their Christmas risotto (and if you tasted it you'd know why). This year we had a contest between Antonio, using local saffron, and Alessandro, using saffron imported from Iran. Unfortunately we couldn't tell the difference once the food was on the table (the feeding frenzy got the best of us). Either way, they were delicious. The joke Alessandro says in the video is this: he pulls out the very special Iranian saffron, shows the illegible writing on it and says "it probably says Esselunga Teheran" ("Esselunga" is a Safeway/Albertsons/Vons-like food chain in Italy).</li>
<li><a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p50138895/" target="video">On Nonno Guido</a>: Guido napping on the granpa that he's named after.</li>
<li><a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p60516598/" target="video">Happy Napper</a>: I didn't manage to film all the many smiles he made in his sleep (you can only see one at the very beginning), but trust me when I say that both Guido Jack and my sister were VERY happy together! ;)</li>
</ul>

<p>Another lesson learned is that a 2-months-old baby is GREAT to travel with. We had the little bassinette on the long stretches, and GJ was small enough to fit on the tray-table on the Frankfurt-Bologna flight (see <a href="http://www.guidojack.com/photos/dec-2005/gallery/img_2686jpg.html">these pictures</a> for other unusual napping places). What I also learned is that toddlers (maybe ages 1 to 3) are HORRIBLE TRAVELLERS. We had screaming devils around us on the plane both ways, and while The Guids was un-phased (slept through it all), all the other travellers in our sections wanted to throw those screaming, wining, restless beasts and their parents off the plane. I don't think I'll do any flying with the baby for those 2-3 years...or I'll buy 50 pairs of ear-plugs and hand them out to people if I do. ;)</p>

<p>More posts soon.</p>
