<h3 id="a000166">He crawls...and a new phase begins</h3>

<p>Guido Jack started crawling today. Forward. He's good at it, like he's been doing it forever.</p>

<p>It turns out he just needed enough motivation to do it...and the webcam / laptop / granparents combo was just the ticket.</p>

<p><a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p92241585/" target="video">Watch Guido Jack's first crawl</a></p>

<p><a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p82871580/" target="video">And his second one to get Cheerios</a></p>

<p>After the videos above were shot, I took GJ to the playground to do some more crawling practice. He was like a completely different baby. A few videos: <a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p20834376/" target="video">here</a>, <a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p72829575/" target="video">here</a> and <a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p43971491/" target="video">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p15443837/" target="video">And here's one on the swing</a></p>

<p>So anyways, once again we feel like we're back at square one in terms of parenting. I'm watching a movie right now but I'll write more tomorrow.</p>

<h3 id="a000165">Reading in two languages</h3>

<p>The other day Guido's buddy Elias came over to play. I read them a book. Here's <a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p34242455/" target="video">a video of it</a>.</p>

<p>Confusing, heh? You can imagine how confusing it was for me (you can see me slipping and addressing Guido Jack in english at some point).</p>

<p>I realize that at this stage (they are both around 8 months old) it probably doesn't make a big difference for them what language they hear...still, this is just the beginning!</p>

<p>How do you deal with multiple kids, when you're trying to speak one language to one and a different one to the other? Do you translate everything you say or most of it or however much you can handle before your head explodes? ;)</p>

<p>I'm exhausted already. Hopefully I'll get used to it and it'll get easier on my poor little brain.</p>

<h3 id="a000161">Mobile Bug</h3>

<p>Our little bug is ready to move!</p>

<p>For the first time today, he managed to get back to the sitting position from being on his tummy: <a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p38337423/" target="video">Tummy to Butt</a></p>

<p>He still enjoys a good game of catch, but he's far too busy moving around...<a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p71129770/" target="video">Playing ball on the rug</a></p>

<h3 id="a000160">Learning and 1st Bidet</h3>

<p>I mentioned in my previous post that GJ watches Signing Time videos in the morning, here's a <a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p73796601/" target="video">short clip</a>...look at how focused he is (reminds me of someone...). ;)</p>

<p>In other news...today he had a particularly nasty blow-out and I was alone with him, so I decided it was a good time to give Guido Jack his first bidet (he is Italian after all...). He seemed to like it! <a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p31577578/" target="video">See for yourself</a></p>

<h3 id="a000154">Ok this is wild</h3>

<p>This just happened: <a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p19162598/" target="video">bouncing ball game</a></p>

<p>Now I know that as parents our views are inherently skewed...but isn't this a bit advanced for a 6 months old? That's a fast-moving object he's grabbing, and with a bounce!</p>

<p>Awesome.</p>

<p><a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p56188282/" target="video">Guido's First Meal</a>: yesterday on his 6th month birthday we made rice cereals and fed it to him. He was a bit perplexed by the flavor and the texture, but he went back for more. And more! I'm excited to do it again today, this is going to be fun (and messy).</p>

<h3 id="a000148">A Dozen more Videos</h3>

<p>Somehow pictures just don't do our baby justice these days...we find our selves shooting a lot more short videos instead.</p>

<p>Here's a fresh batch:<br />
- <a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p94172559/" target="video">playing</a> - we were trying to get different views of his big head, but his eyes just LOVE to follow the camera...oh well.<br />
- <a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p59753384/" target="video">Finger-Sucker</a> - Mariah was trying to get a shot of her view of the baby after she breastfeeds him (she assures it's priceless). Again, he spotted the camera...<br />
- <a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p64184759/" target="video">Sitting up</a> - sitting up by himself like a big boy...but not for too long! ;)<br />
- <a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p63508026/" target="video">Daytime baking</a> - blowing rasberries...screaming...baking...FUN!<br />
- <a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p11133255/" target="video">Falling Asleep</a> - we love how his arms relaxing always wake him up a little...so peaceful<br />
- <a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p67788920/" target="video">His Favorite toy</a> - ok so this toy I made might not look very good, but he likes it! It's water, olive oil and a baby carrot in a baby bottle. The oil was not supposed to mix with the water (for a "lava-lamp" effect), but for some reason it did and now the water just looks yellowish...yuck. Guido doesn't mind...<br />
- <a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p34435585/" target="video">Excersaucer madness</a> - one moment he's playing peacefully, the next he goes nuts! Awesome.<br />
- <a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p10403182/" target="video">Cute-issimo!</a> - we love our bug.<br />
- <a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p38365978/" target="video">Space Cadet</a> - a tired bug spacing out in his excersaucer.<br />
- <a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p52347376/" target="video">Breakfast fun</a> - with Gabe at a diner in the Mission<br />
- <a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p99442620/" target="video">Street Patrol</a> - Guido Jack loves to look at the street and the train and the dogs and the trees and the birds...watch out for the surprise ending! (no worries, he's fine)</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h3 id="a000142">Our Bimbo loves his Bumbo</h3>

<p><img alt="IMG_2992.JPG" title="IMG_2992.JPG" src="http://www.guidojack.com/photos/imgs/IMG_2992.JPG" width="480" height="360" /></p>

<p>We just got the <a href="http://www.bumboseat.com">Bumbo Chair</a> for Guido Jack, and it's as if he grew 3 months in one day. Just seeing him sitting up like an older baby makes a huge difference. My favourite thing about it is that he is so much closer to the table and with a much wider viewing angle...today he "helped" me make a marinade for the ribs we're cooking tomorrow (what's up superbowl sunday!).</p>

<p>Here's a little video of him enjoying a sock or two on his bumbo: <a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p94598693/" target="video">http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p94598693/</a></p>

<p>A couple more videos:<br />
<a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p83413308/" target="video">Playing with his Pony</a>: we took this video because his legs were being pretty cute<br />
<a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p33282562/" target="video">Playing the Su-Giu' game with Daddy</a>: when we don't have the camera running (a.k.a. the most fascinating thing in the world for GJ) he laughs twice as hard...oh well, he's not for show anyways... ;)</p>

<p>Oh, and I posted some more Jan and Feb pictures on <a href="http://www.guidojack.com">GuidoJack.com</a></p>

<p>P.S.Thanks for Jan Garcia for <a href="http://www.jangarcia.com/journal/2005/11/22/magic-chair/">showing us the Bumbo</a></p>

<h3 id="a000132">Christmas Holidays Videos</h3>

<p>Ciao Italia!</p>

<p>We just got back from Guido's firsts Christmas in Italia, and it was a blast.</p>

<p>I added 103 pictures to the <a href="http://www.guidojack.com/photos/dec-2005/gallery/">December 2005 gallery</a> on guidojack.com, and here are some videos I took while we were there.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p52609142/" target="video">Christmas Eve</a>: hanging out in Uggiate with the family.</li>
<li><a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p80898636/" target="video">Christmas Day</a>: this year we only had a small subset of the family over: 30 people (you think I'm kidding). Here's The Guids on his bis-nonna (great-granma) Enrica.</li>
<li><a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p57596306/" target="video">Sock-Drawer-Crib</a>: sometimes I wonder why we even bought a crib at home. We used sock-drawers padded with a folded-up bath towel wherever we went in Italy and they worked great! Look how happy GJ is in this one.</li>
<li>Views from La Sperduta <a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p82753157/" target="video">one</a>, <a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p10991646/" target="video">two</a> and <a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p44018283/" target="video">three</a>: my dad's new house on the countryside is absolutely stunning. These are the views from it in the winter (imagine what they're like in the other seasons, with the fields full of sunflowers and wheat. I'll take more videos this summer when we go back.</li>
<li><a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p30363583/" target="video">Risotto Contest</a>: the Milan-side of my family takes great pride in their Christmas risotto (and if you tasted it you'd know why). This year we had a contest between Antonio, using local saffron, and Alessandro, using saffron imported from Iran. Unfortunately we couldn't tell the difference once the food was on the table (the feeding frenzy got the best of us). Either way, they were delicious. The joke Alessandro says in the video is this: he pulls out the very special Iranian saffron, shows the illegible writing on it and says "it probably says Esselunga Teheran" ("Esselunga" is a Safeway/Albertsons/Vons-like food chain in Italy).</li>
<li><a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p50138895/" target="video">On Nonno Guido</a>: Guido napping on the granpa that he's named after.</li>
<li><a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/p60516598/" target="video">Happy Napper</a>: I didn't manage to film all the many smiles he made in his sleep (you can only see one at the very beginning), but trust me when I say that both Guido Jack and my sister were VERY happy together! ;)</li>
</ul>

<p>Another lesson learned is that a 2-months-old baby is GREAT to travel with. We had the little bassinette on the long stretches, and GJ was small enough to fit on the tray-table on the Frankfurt-Bologna flight (see <a href="http://www.guidojack.com/photos/dec-2005/gallery/img_2686jpg.html">these pictures</a> for other unusual napping places). What I also learned is that toddlers (maybe ages 1 to 3) are HORRIBLE TRAVELLERS. We had screaming devils around us on the plane both ways, and while The Guids was un-phased (slept through it all), all the other travellers in our sections wanted to throw those screaming, wining, restless beasts and their parents off the plane. I don't think I'll do any flying with the baby for those 2-3 years...or I'll buy 50 pairs of ear-plugs and hand them out to people if I do. ;)</p>

<p>More posts soon.</p>

<p>Yes, the turkey was 3lb heavier than the baby. I love the look on him, it's like he's thinking "God my dad is a weirdo...".</p>

<h3 id="a000125">Pacifier Video</h3>

<p>Here's a new little video of our little one: <a href="http://macromedia.breezecentral.com/p67032721/" target="video">Guido vs. Pacifier</a></p>

<p>Now before half of you post horrified comments about how pacifiers are the root of all evil, let me give you our perspective:</p>

<p>- first of all, chill out<br />
- nipple confusion: the little one has been exclusively sucking on M.'s boobs for the first month of his life, and loving it. He knows what it's like and is in no danger of forgetting it at this point.<br />
- pacifier addiction: I fully understand that babies don't cry because they are trying to tell you "I want a pacifier!"...it's usually some other reason. So giving them a pacifier doesn't fix the cause of their crying... So our strategy is to give him a pacifier only when he's hungry (while the boob gets ready or the stored breastmilk gets warmed up to room temperature) OR when he's cranky because he's tired, needs pacifying and he can't find his hand.<br />
- because of how spoiled our baby is with Mariah's nipples, he won't take the bottle easily yet. But he'll suck on the pacifier. So when I want him to suck on the bottle I give him the pacifier, let him suck until he spits it out or it falls out, and quickly replace it with the bottle. His mouth is already in 'sucking mode' and he'll suck on the bottle happily (ok, maybe for just a few minutes, then I have to do the same trick again).<br />
- again, chill out, it's fine. Better to pacify on a piece of silicone than on mom's boobs, right moms? ;)</p>

<h3 id="a000107">More pics and videos</h3>

<p>We've been getting a couple of visitors a day (great pace, I recommend it), who bring us dinner and hold our baby while we shower. I have uploaded a bunch of pictures on <a href="http://www.guidojack.com">guidojack.com</a>.</p>

<p>I also took another couple of short videos:<br />
<a href="http://macromedia.breezecentral.com/p45721438/" target="video">Smelly feet or crazy mom?</a><br />
<a href="http://macromedia.breezecentral.com/p47613025/" target="video">Saturday Morning Breakfast</a></p>

<p>It looks like the weather is opening up, so we might go on our second walk ever later today. I'm sure I won't resist taking some more pics then...ah the age of the digital camera... ;)</p>
